A library focused on extraction and analysis of reliable data on the indian economy

# The data
One way of understanding the economy is to look at data. To undestand something as complex as the economic machine, we need lots of data across a variety of fields - financial markets, develompnet indicators, business indicators etc.

# The analysis
Although economics is not a pure science in that you cannot your hypothesis regarding the economy using a controlled setup - I believe that having a scientific approach towards establishing fundamental  cause - effect relationships can yield more insights than trusting readymade theoretical models
